BraidBot
========

A framework for easily writing Braid bots.

The easiest way to get started is to use the `braidbot/insta` language:

```racket
#lang braidbot/insta

;; minimum bot just needs the act-on-message function defined
(define (act-on-message msg)
  (reply-to msg "Hi there!"
    #:bot-id "..."
    #:bot-token "..."))
```

For a simple example, see [rot13bot](https://github.com/braidchat/rot13bot).

For a full example, see [reminderbot](https://github.com/braidchat/reminderbot).

## Creating a Bot

Install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org).

Create a new project: `raco pkg new mycoolbot`

Add dependency to `info.rkt`: `"https://github.com/braidchat/braidbot.git#v1.1"

Edit `main.rkt`.
You can use the `braidbot/insta` language or require the library modules & use them directly, if you wish.

For the `insta` language, a good starting point is something like the following:

```racket
#lang braidbot/insta

;; Set the bot-id, bot-token, and braid-url in environment variables
;; e.g.
;; BOT_ID='...' BOT_TOKEN='...' BRAID_URL='...' racket -t main.rkt
(define bot-id (getenv "BOT_ID"))
(define bot-token (getenv "BOT_TOKEN"))
(define braid-url (getenv "BRAID_URL"))

;; set the port the bot will listen on
(listen-port 8899)

;; set a function to run on startup
(on-init (Î» () (println "Bot starting")))

;; required function you must implement
;; `msg` is the decoded message that the bot has recieved
;; note that, if it's a mention, the content will begin with `/botname`
(define (act-on-message msg)
  (println "Got a message:")
  (println (hash-ref msg '#:content))
  ;; reply-to is a function from braidbot/braid (which is automatically required
  ;; by the `insta` language) that sends a message in reply to `msg`, to the same thread.
  ;; If you want to start a new thread, you can use `send-message`.
  (reply-to msg "Hi, I'm a bot!"
    #:bot-id bot-id
    #:bot-token bot-token
    #:braid-url braid-url))
```

## Testing Your Bot

Add a bot to your local Braid install, configure your bot to use the local URL for the `braidbot/braid` communication functions, and the bot-id & bot-token.

The first time you start it, you'll need to install the package for your bot, which will also download the dependencies.
You can do this by running `raco pkg install` in the directory containing the `info.rkt` file.

Once the package is installed, you can run the bot with `racket -t main.rkt`.

## Deploying Your Bot

Once you have your bot ready, you can create an executable using `raco exe main.rkt -o mycoolbot`.

Then to create a standalone executable, with the libraries bundled in, use `raco distribute`, like:

`raco distribute deploy mycoolbot`

This will create a directory called `deploy` that you can zip up, upload to your server, and run `bin/mycoolbot`.
